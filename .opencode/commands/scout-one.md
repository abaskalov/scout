description: Finish one Scout item completely
subtask: false
---

Load and follow the `scout-manual-workflow` skill.

Mode: one Scout item.

Goal: handle exactly one Scout item and drive it to the furthest honest final state: `done` when target-environment verification or user acceptance is possible, otherwise `review`, `testing`, or `in_progress` with exact evidence and blocker notes.

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS` is optional hint only: item id, item URL, project, or short scope. Empty arguments mean use `SCOUT_PROJECT_SLUG` or available Scout context and choose the best next actionable item.

Use the skill as the source of truth for intake, related-item checks, implementation, verification, commit/deploy decisions, structured evidence, Russian Scout notes, and status transitions.

This command explicitly allows focused local commits required for Scout handoff. Do not push or deploy unless the repository workflow or user request explicitly allows it.

Boundaries:
- Do not start a second unrelated Scout item.
- If related items share the same root cause, link/update them only when their own acceptance condition can be checked.

Final response: item id/title, final status, what changed, verification evidence, Scout evidence/note updates, commit/branch/PR/deploy if any, and any remaining blocker.
